\arguments{
\item{data}{Outcome to be modeled by the ensemble. This is a TxM matriz.}

\item{Y_test}{(Optional) include the data to allow for a forecast. This will result in not saving all the tree info in the container.}

\item{n_ahead}{(Optional) include the forecasting horizon, default h = 12 if you don't provide.}

\item{lags}{Number of Lags used in the VAR(p) system.}

\item{bart_prior}{Which Prior we are going to use in the BART: CGM, DART or Minn.}

\item{SV}{Stochastic Volatility Flag.}

\item{num_burnin}{Number of "burn-in" iterations of the MCMC sampler. Default: 100.}

\item{num_mcmc}{Number of "retained" iterations of the MCMC sampler. Default: 100.}

\item{num_thin}{}

\item{keep_burnin}{Whether or not "burn-in" samples should be stored. Default FALSE.}

\item{params}{}
}
\value{
List of sampling outputs and a wrapper around the sampled forests (which can be used for in-memory prediction on new data).
